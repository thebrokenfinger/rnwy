# rnwy

> Pronounced "runway," **rnwy** is a super simple, lightweight Node.js framework for building web applications. It draws inspiration from Ruby on Rails.

## What's rnwy?

**rnwy** is intentionally designed as a _toy framework_ and exhibits minimalistic approach with its limited features. Built to serve specific needs and dev experience, it emulates the conventions, features and project directory structure with some variations (obviously). **rnwy** uses [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), a high-performance web framework for Node.js, as the server.

## Why?

I am building this project to retain the joy I experience when building web applications with Ruby on Rails. Since, at times, the need arises to write backend and services in Node.js, I want to have a similar experience doing so.

## What's included?

- [ ] Routing
- [ ] Controllers
- [ ] Job Queues (to run things later)

The features above are the ones I need to build the services I am working on. I will add more features as I need them.
