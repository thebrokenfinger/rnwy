# rnwy

> Pronounced "runway", **rnwy** is a Rails-inspired framework for building web apps and services in JavaScript.

## What's rnwy?

**rnwy** is a framework for building web apps and services in JavaScript. It is inspired by Ruby on Rails, and borrows many of its conventions, features, and project structure. **rnwy** is built on top of [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), a high-performance web framework for Node.js.

## State of the Project

**rnwy** is currently in the early stages of development. I am building it because I didn't want to lose the productivity and joy of working with Rails when I am writing apps in JavaScript. I am using it to build a few personal projects, and I will continue to add features and fix bugs as I encounter them.
